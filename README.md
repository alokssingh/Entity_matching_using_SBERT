📌 Project Overview

This project performs Entity Matching between farm names scrapped from open-source websites and a clean dataset. The primary goal is to clean and standardize the scrapped names and use SBERT (Sentence-BERT) to match similar entities accurately. The project is developed as part of a solution for Barclays.

🔍 Key Features

Web Scraping: Extracts farm names from open-source sites.

Data Cleaning: Preprocesses scrapped data to remove inconsistencies.

SBERT for Entity Matching: Uses Sentence-BERT (SBERT) to compute similarity between farm names.

Matching Algorithm: Identifies the best match from the clean dataset.

Evaluation Metrics: Measures the accuracy of entity matching using relevant metrics.
